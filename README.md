# Project Tasks
1. Study in detail the load disaggregation and its importance.
2. Survey the existing techniques for load disaggregation in the literature.
3. Use your own household dataset or open public access dataset of appliance load
consumption.
4. Implement a deep learning model for load disaggregation of various household
appliances and compare results with other machine learning techniques.
