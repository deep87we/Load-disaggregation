# Load-disaggregation of Household appliances using Deep Learning
This is a course project of EN 304 Energy engineering ,done in a group of 3 members under the guidance of Course Instructor and Project Mentor
<br/>
**Course Intstructor**:-Zakir Hussain Rather(Professor at IIT Bombay)
<br/>
**Project Mentor**:-Dhiraj Khadka(PHD Student at IIT Bombay)

# Project Tasks
1. Study in detail the load disaggregation and its importance.
2. Survey the existing techniques for load disaggregation in the literature.
3. Use your own household dataset or open public access dataset of appliance load
consumption.
4. Implement a deep learning model for load disaggregation of various household
appliances and compare results with other machine learning techniques.
